    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When it comes to chicken there just isn’t anything more delicious than a juicy, crusty piece of finger-licking good fried chicken. It might seem intimidating to fry your
    own chicken, but it’s actually pretty straightforward and it puts grocery store and fast food fried chicken to shame.  If you have a thermometer for the oil and a timer,
    you can produce fail-proof fried chicken.  If you’ve ever wanted to make your own fried chicken, now is the time to try!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>30 saltine crackers</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dry potato flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place crackers in a large resealable plastic bag; seal bag and crush crackers with a rolling pin until they are coarse crumbs. Add the flour, potato flakes,
        seasoned salt, and pepper and mix well.</li>
        <li>Beat egg in a shallow dish or bowl. One by one, dredge chicken pieces in egg, then place in bag with crumb mixture. Seal bag and shake to coat.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fry chicken, turning frequently, until golden brown and juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
