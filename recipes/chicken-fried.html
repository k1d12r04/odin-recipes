    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Fried is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried.
    The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>30 saltine crackers</li>
